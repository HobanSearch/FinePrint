All components are in place and ready to run. Follow these simple steps to get Fine Print AI running locally.

## 📋 Prerequisites Confirmed
- ✅ Docker Desktop is running
- ✅ Node.js 20+ installed
- ✅ All services configured
- ✅ Docker Compose ready

## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Everything
```bash

- **Main App**: http://localhost:3003
- **Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:3003/admin
- **API Explorer**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Temporal Workflows**: http://localhost:8088

## 🧪 Test the AI Improvement System

### Quick Test - Start an A/B Test
```bash
npm run test:improvement
```

### Watch It Work
1. Open Admin Dashboard: http://localhost:3003/admin
2. Navigate to "Experiments" tab
3. Watch real-time A/B test progress
4. See automatic model improvements in action

## 📊 Monitor Everything

### Real-time Health Dashboard
```bash
npm run health
```

### View Logs

## 🔍 First Time Setup Tips

1. **Be Patient**: First startup downloads Docker images (~5GB)
2. **Check Docker**: Ensure Docker Desktop has enough resources (8GB RAM minimum)
3. **Model Init**: Business agent models initialize in background (takes 2-3 minutes)
4. **Verify Health**: Use `npm run health` to confirm everything is running

- **System Architecture**: [backend/ARCHITECTURE.md](backend/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs (after starting)

## ⚡ Quick Troubleshooting

### If services fail to start:
```bash
# Check Docker
docker ps -a

# Restart specific service

docker-compose restart [service-name]

# View detailed logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]
```

### If models aren't loading:
```bash
npm run init:models
```

### To completely reset:
```bash
npm run clean
npm run start:all
```
