## Usage with Claude Code

### Sequential Development
```bash
# Week 1: Foundation
claude --task "Setup Fine Print AI project"
# Use Project Setup + DevOps Agents

# Week 2: Backend
claude --task "Build analysis API"
# Use Backend + Database + Ollama Agents

# Week 3: Frontend
claude --task "Create React UI"

1. Code quality (linting, tests)
2. Performance benchmarks met
3. Security requirements passed
4. Documentation completeness
5. Integration success with other components

### Debugging Agents (19-30)
Each debugging agent's effectiveness should be measured by:
1. Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) improvement
2. Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) reduction
3. Root cause identification accuracy
4. False positive/negative rates
5. Knowledge base contribution quality
6. Incident prevention through proactive detection
7. Debug session efficiency and completeness
